## Hotel Room Locking System

Security is one of the primary concerns for customers in a hotel. Traditional lock and key system is exposed to lack of safety to our belongings.

This project aims at creating hotel room locking system for the guests who wish to have a secure stay. Access control is the basis for automation of hotels and apartments in the current time.  An efficient method of generating a unique encrypted password for each guest ensures tight security and reduces risk of robbery. It is implemented as a graphical user interface system which involves locking and unlocking of the hotel room door through a room-key security swiping machine.

Access to the room is granted only if the guest swipes his key and enters the password which was generated uniquely to him. Generation of this particular password is done for first time when he books the hotel room. It involves the concepts of affine cipher encryption. And when it comes to this type of encryption system we can assure the customers with higher level of security, because hacking of the mathematical function used in generating the password is very tedious and time consumimg.
